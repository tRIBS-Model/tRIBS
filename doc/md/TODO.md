# tRIBS TODO

### Todo
- [ ] Finalize updated benchmarks 
- [ ] Update input file and input work flow to address the fact that specifying .mdf in the input file does not work or is superseded by the .sdf
- [ ] Update flow for reading in dynamic LU grids--this is a bottleneck in terms of speed
### Finished
- [x] Merged tSnowIntercept with tSnowPack
- [x] Fixed larger memory leaks when running in parallel
- [x] Update .in file and inputs, including moving command line flags and unnecessary options in .in files
- [x] Fix compiler warnings (sprintf to sprintnf, etc ...)
- [x] Update compiler flags and release version for optimized performance
